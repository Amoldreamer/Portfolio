           <h4 style="color:white" id="content">Ever since writing my first hello world program my fingers have not stopped. Born and 
               raised in Nepal, I moved to Portugal at the age of 36. Having moved to a new place and suddenly finding myself
               in a completely new cultural and language environment I had to take on jobs that I was not really interested in. But at the
               same time I also discovered a passion for programming and began to learn software development whenever I had free time.
               Hence, after almost one year of playing around with languages like PHP(including Laravel), MSQL, HTML/CSS and a little of Vanilla
               Javascript, I feel eligible to apply as a junior developer -- and yes, I am a self-taught web-developer.
